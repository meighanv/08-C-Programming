## 1. Write a C program that implements a binary search algorithm.
```
Example output:

Array: 5 10 15 20 25 26 34 56 77

Please enter the searched key: 26
The key 26 was found at 5 ( Starting from 0)

```
### 2. Search the file numbers.txt  that has a sorted 2D array. Create a program to search for a number from the file and also display something if the number is not found. 


## Real world problems in searching a file:

### 3. Power Plant Data. 
The data file power1.txt contains a power plant output in megawatts over a period of 8 weeks. Each row of data contains 7 integers that represent 1 weeks data. In developing the following programs, use symbolic constants NROWS and NCOLS to represent the number of rows and the number of columns in the array used to store the data.

A.)Write a program to compute and print the average power output over this period of time. Also print the number of days with greater-than-average power output.

B.) Write a program to print the day of the week and the number of the week on which the minimum power output occurred. If there are several days with the minimum power output, print the information for each day.
