# Performance Lab 2

## Write a program that prints out a report giving the Maximum wave height for the tsunamis in "waves2.txt." Include the average wave height(in feet) and the location of all tsunamis with a wave height higher than the average. 

*note: In the data file, I have replaced spaces with underscores in the character strings so that they will be read as a single character string.*
```
Arrangement of information on the ".txt" file: 
09 02 1992 170 10 Nicaragua  ->   month    day   year    fatalities     max wave ht.(m)  Country
```
